# Emotion-Detection

  This project focuses on the intersection of computer vision and emotion recognition by employing the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for object detection. The primary objective 
is to train a machine learning model to identify and classify various facial expressions, thereby predicting human emotions in real-time or in static images. The emotions the model
is designed to recognize include neutral, happy, sad, anger, and fear.
